# The LAByrinth Project Lab Manual

This lab manual draws upon the collectively-honed insights and pathbreaking work of the Civic Laboratory for Environmental Action Research (CLEAR), a feminist, anti-colonial lab specializing in monitoring plastic pollution, directed by Max Liboiron. See the Jan 1, 2018 snapshot of [CLEAR Lab Book](https://civiclaboratory.nl/clear-lab-book/). In particular lab guidelines 1-8 were drawn directly from the CLEAR Lab Book and then adapted with minor edits. The value framework blurb as well as the onboarding and exiting protocols are directly drawn from the CLEAR Lab Book. Text on faculty responsibilities is almost entirely from the [Aly Lab Book](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual/blob/master/aly-lab-manual.pdf) and that lab book also inspired some language in the Work Autonomously guideline. The child care guideline is entirely in debt to Kate Cairns syllabus policy you can see [here](https://twitter.com/katefcairns/status/1222274604426825730/photo/1). 

The Manual would not exist in this form without Nick Shapiro's [Carceral Ecologies Lab Book](https://github.com/Carceral-Ecologies/lab_book) from which the structure, content, and aforementioned citations were borrowed with minor edits.

##	__Value Framework__
 
We communicate our values in the hopes that they will ground our actions and decisions in what we hold important. It is our aspiration that all actions and outputs of the lab are reflective of these values.

1. Highest possible quality work, by standards we hold ourselves to.
2. Critical local awareness (Understand where you are and why it matters to you and others)
3. Participation and Autonomy: Everyone brings something.
4. Humor, Joy, Curiosity.

## Glossary of Terms
[TBD] A glossary of terms we use including our values is located [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1LH2bwnm4T5HTRTwIB4nF-Lrtso8dE6D0iBCZ2NVg1fQ/edit?usp=sharing).

## The kind of work we do in Labyrinth

### Methods: Curiosity

 - **reading**.  Becoming an expert about Los Angeles, Ecologies, science and technology, culture and history can only happen by reading a lot.  Labyrinth members are curious, read widely, share what they are learning, and recognize how difficult it is to know a lot of diverse stuff.   Reading comes in many forms: slow, fast, deep, close, surface, familiar, unfamiliar, active, passive...  but what they all share is that you are building your own conceptual labyrinth by reading, and you have to have the curiosity and patience to do that if you want to do research. 

 - **thinking with concepts, inquiry**.  Finding **concepts** to work with means identifying ideas that have weight, complexity and specificity.  Sometimes we are given these concepts to think about, for instance "animal rights", and sometimes we have to change or invent them to make progress. 
 
 - **observation and being in the city**.  Active being in and with Los Angeles is key to our work.  Although reading is important, being in the city, listening, hearing, smelling, interacting, maybe even participating or intervening, eventually teach you more than reading alone will.  **Noticing** requires going back and forth between reading and being in the city.  Sometimes getting a little bored is also necessary before you notice something.  

 - **methods for talking to and with other people**.  A core rule in Labyrinth is the **everyone is expert in something** both us, and the people we might talk to.  We do not extract data from people or try to understand what they think in any other way than by inviting them to conversation.  If collaboration emerges that is fantastic.  If it does not, then we are simply learning, not "doing research". 
 
 - **methods for identifying and gathering "data"**.  Data is made not born.  There is no such thing as raw data.  Every act of creating or analyzing data should be something we investigate, critically review, and double check.  Data---the word--- refers to things that are supposedly given or simply there.  But all data had to begin with noticing.  You do not own the data you collect, it is not yours to do whatever you please with it.  When we make data we make relations with someone or some entity, and those relations come with responsibilities. 
  
- **methods for creating**.  Labyrinth, as a project, tries to preserve the liberty to produce in diverse ways and to engage the creativity and skills of members.  Writing? yes of course, we do that.  but also: thinking about other forms of expression or communication.  For our podcast series we think about story-telling and theatrics; we have the opportunity to think about our work as a board game of role-playing game---what would that be?  for our website or for presentations, do we have straightforward findings to communicate, or do we want to challenge audiences to think differently about something, or are working collaboratively with a partner who needs the authority of UCLA research to do what they do? 

## How the Labyrinth Project works

**We are an experiment in participatory research.**  This means several things

  - **Labyrinth projects are more than the sum of their parts**. In humanities and social science most research was traditionally individual and solitary.  In Labyrinth everything we try to share as much as possible.  We share the materials, data, methods, and projects with all the members, even though individual people take the lead on them, and deserve credit for the work they do.  
  
  - **We do exploratory research.**  this means, for the most part, that we don't always know why we are doing something at the outset.  If we did, it wouldn't be research.  Sometimes that means we go down a path a long way before we stop and admit that it isn't leading anywhere.  Trust your intuitions, because they are what we rely on to find out interesting things. Check in frequently and talk about what you are trying to do. 
  
  - **A pedagogical experiment** For *grad students*, the Labyrinth project is an opportunity to do research outside of your dissertation and outside of your normal methods, if you want.  There are no rules or regulations other than the values listed above for the kind of work you do with Labyrinth, and neither Labyrinth nor the PI/Postdocs  make any claim on your dissertation work.  For *undergrads* the goal should be to experience research from start to finish, and to learn a set of skills that can be used in both research and non-research settings. 

 -  **Hierarchy for some things, equality for most everything else**  Figure out how, when and what you will be responsible for together with others.  No one will tell you want to do in Labyrinth, but you can always ask what you can do and propose things you think you would like to do.  

 - **Everyone should produce something**.  Most scholarly work (publications and books) takes a LONG time to produce, longer than most undergraduates are involved, and even some grad students.  Therefore, the goal is to try to make whatever can be finished in the time you have to participate, and then other people can build on that (including the PI or postdocs who take responsibility for getting things to publication.  That might mean that your goal is a map, a data set or a short working paper, instead of a complete and published scholarly work.  Focus on the intermediate steps, and take joy when it all comes together eventually. 

4. **Negotiate credit along the way.**  Ideas take shape in different ways, no one ever has an idea all on their own.  Talk regularly about who is doing what kinds of work, and who should be credited for contributing.  Acknowledge the work of others who you do not directly work with, and credit prior work clearly.  


## Lab Guidelines

1. **If you are sick, heartbroken, or exhausted, go home.** This work is not more important than your well being. This guideline supersedes the following guidelines on attendance and is complementary to many of those that follow. Communicating when you have to bow out is preferred but we recognize that is not always possible.

For a list of UCLA Campus Resources for Student Support please see [this list](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1RC9_vNrYTN9sylZM7HySeh21iTXRzwaUdBdo6_ngg00/edit?usp=sharing).

2. *Attend lab and working group meetings.* Lab meetings (1.5 hrs/week) and working group meetings (1 hr/week) are the main ways that we operate as an entire lab, and as a community. All-hands lab meetings are where we discuss the values, concepts, goals, and ideas that underlie all our work as a lab, and therefore are where we work out how and why we work. Without the meetings, we are just some people working on some stuff. If you are not going to make a lab meeting, note it in the #general channel on discord. You *don't need to explain why* you won't be in attendance. 

 - Working group meetings occur without Chris (although he can be invited in or ask permission to join) and they are a time to work together in a non-agenda-driven space without faculty presence in order to self-organize. Meetings are usually led by the Undergraduate/Graduate/Postdoc leading the project, but should still be a collaborative space. If you are not going to be able to make a working group meeting note it in the channel for the project you're working on, so your collaborators know what to expect. You *don't need to explain why* you won't be in attendance, but please don't get in the habit of not attending meetings. If you do, someone from the lab will reach out to you to make sure you're ok.  
    
    Here are some ways to structure working group meetings:
    * Quick check in. 
    * If starting a new project go over the boring logistics of the workflow so no one gets lost in the protocol.
    * Updates on current project.
    * Where everyone is at and what questions are keeping you from moving forward (even if folks haven't started yet they can learn from other people's questions).
    * If nearing the end of a project set a clear deadline to finish or to at the very least provide an update on where you left off. 

3. *Work autonomously, with others*. We trust and depend on you to get your projects done, and there won’t be a lot of oversight to ensure that is happening. Chris cares for the lab as a whole, while lab members care for projects, each other, and themselves. Our work is collaborative not competitive. Respect each others strengths and weaknesses. We will all inevitably struggle with some aspect of our work. When you need help, reach out to other lab members. **We expect that you are able to ask for help when you need it, and to problem solve.** We are all here to help. You are always welcome to check in with Chris or Sophia, but you were invited to join the lab because you’re smart and can figure things out, so try that first. Mistakes will be made. That’s cool. We admit our mistakes and we communicate them to others so that mistakes aren't repeated and then we move on.

4. *Take care of each other, and yourself*. When you first start, work in pairs so other lab members are there to answer questions or lend a hand. If you notice other lab members are struggling, provide whatever support you can, or tell someone that you think can help them. Listen to each other or respect each others desire for quiet when we need it. Lab members are always encouraged to speak their mind and communicate their concerns/questions. You can always bring Sophia or Chris in to provide concrete support if you or another lab member requires it.

5. *Take breaks*! Studies have shown that taking regular breaks makes you more productive. It’s also important to care for yourself.

6. *Take your ideas seriously*. Many of the lab tasks are for ongoing projects in which we are beholden to community groups, granters, or others. But we are always interested in new projects or new ways of doing ongoing projects. We’re especially interested in ideas for how to make our work more feminist, decolonial, ethical, and equitable. If you have an idea for something you want to explore or develop, let us know! Post your idea in #kindling channel (and let people know in #general that you've posted it). {Kindling protocol, under development}

7. *Honor each other's time*. Because the lab is member-run, if you are meeting others, it is important that you are on time so that others are not waiting for you. If you’re running late, text ahead and let people know when you expect to arrive. You can also use discord but people's notifications may not be setup to get the message in a timely way, so its best to get the numbers of folks you're meeting up with *before* you’re late. We understand that things comes up and clear communication is the way we stay our course when one of us is running late or has to reconsider the extent of their commitments to our collective work. Honoring each other's time is not just about showing up when we say we will but also routinely appreciating the labor and time of other members. This is everyday work, but significant moments or efforts can additionally be recognized in the #appreciation channel. 

8. *Acknowledge the shoulders & Land you stand on*. When you make presentations from the work that has happened in the lab, always include an acknowledgment page as your last slide that thanks people who contributed in various ways by name, as well as the lab itself. For papers, do the same with author orders and citation. All presentations should include an Indigenous Land Acknowledgment at the beginning and all papers should include such an acknowledgment in the acknowledgments section. This is because environmental science owes a great debt to those who have, and continue to, care for the Land of Turtle Island. Repeating these truths is a small part of the work of counteracting Indigenous erasure and a way of practicing equity, humility and solidarity. You can find UCLA's protocol for Land Acknowledgment [here](https://chancellor.ucla.edu/messages/acknowledging-native-peoples-ucla-events/). 

9. *Don't get lost in enumeration*. When we conduct quantitative assessments we will not lose track of “how”, “why”, and "what can we do about it" as we attempt to distill “how much.” The means that we have an attentiveness to the quality of our own process and the values they reflect. But this also means that our enumerate work must be complemented by qualitative historical understandings of the processes that led to what we are recording, as well as look towards how an otherwise future might be achieved.

10. *Child Care*. Some people have care responsibilities for a child or children in their life, whether as a parent, an older sibling, cousin, etc. If your childcare needs ever come into conflict with the lab schedule, please don't feel as though you need to miss a lab meeting. We understand that sometimes plans fall though. If this happens, you are welcome to bring a child to lab meetings or lab work with you. We simply ask that you bring materials to keep them busy, and remain mindful of your classmates. 

11. *Animals*.  Animals are welcome in the lab, and appreciated, but please check in with the other members first if you can, not everyone has the same levels of comfort.  In a pinch a pet can hang out in Chris's office.  The campus also has rules about animals, which you should be mindful of. 


### Methods of Support

There are a few different ways we can support your work within the LAByrinth Project, methods of support (detailed below) depend on the capacity in which you join which are as follows: 

* Volunteer - lots of appreciation and the occasional pizza. Great if you want fun research experience and don't need class credit or want to develop your own project. 

* Class Credit - HBS majors and Society + Genetics minors can enroll in a Winter SOC GEN 196 class for unit credit. This requires project development and individual deliverables which are decided on at the beginning of the quarter by you and Chris. 

* Spring/Summer Research - After enrolling in and completing a Winter 196 class students can further develop their projects as undergraduate researchers for the lab and be paid to do so through Spring and Summer. 


#### Supporting Undergraduate Research

Undergraduate Research Fellows Program (Due October 15 – November 15)[link](http://sciences.ugresearch.ucla.edu/programs-and-scholarships/urfp)

Library Undergrad research awards (Due April 1st) [link](https://www.library.ucla.edu/research-teaching-support/support-students/showcasing-student-achievement/library-prize-undergraduate-research) humanities, social science, and arts [here](http://hass.ugresearch.ucla.edu/scholarships/urfp/)

Summer Programs for Undergraduate Research (various due dates, early spring) [link](https://grad.ucla.edu/admissions/diversity/summer-programs-for-undergraduate-research-spur/)

Undergrad Research Week (Spring) [Link](https://urweek.ugresearch.ucla.edu/) + Dean's prize (Spring) [Link](https://urweek.ugresearch.ucla.edu/apply/#deansprize)

LAEP [link](https://financialaid.ucla.edu/special-aid-programs/learning-aligned-education-program)

#### Supporting Graduate Research

The Labyrinth project will, funding permitting, fund graduate students willing to do a research project at up to ten hours a week for 1 quarter, and/or at 50-100% during the summer.  Every GSR has to be negotiated with Chris, and involves working with undergrads, postdocs or faculty on a project with clear goals.  The Labyrinth project does not fund graduate students to complete dissertation work in their home department (unless Chris happens to be your dissertation advisor). 


### A Note on Authorship

Our aim is to give due credit to all; authorship is determined differently based on the medium of publication their requirements. 

* Formal Journals: Authorship distribution is set before work on the deliverable commences.  
* The LAByrinth Project Website: Undergraduates/Graduates who work on the deliverable will (usually) get full authorship. 
* Other mediums: To be determined before work begins by the authors and Chris. 

## What Resources do I Have Access to as a LAByrinth Member? How Do I Use Them?

### Spaces

1. Archiving Room: LAByrinth has an archiving room filled with all sorts of fun things. It is located in LSB Floor 3 scross the hall from Chris' office, inside a door, all the way at the end. Ask the ISG Main Office to let you in M-W 5am-5pm, otherwise ask Chris and he will let you in if he is on campus (he usually is). 

2. ISG hallway outside Archiving Room: There are desks and chairs and a couch outside the archiving room that can be used to work on LAByrinth work, just let Chris, Ana, or Nancy know to let you in.

## Lab Protocols 

Guidelines are general rules and principles, whereas protocols are precise and detailed plans that maintain practices across our group and within science, social science, and organizing—it defines the way we *ought* to proceed in different situations.


### Onboarding to the lab
Welcome to the lab!

First thing that will happen as a part of our onboarding proccess is that you will be invited to our discord.  @ckelty or @soph can issue invites to Discord. Once in Discord:

* New to Discord? Here's a [tutorial](https://support.discord.com/hc/en-us/articles/360045138571-Beginner-s-Guide-to-Discord).

* Now that you understand the platform a bit more, go to the #start-here channel and get access to our Notion workspace, there you'll find our LAByrinth Wiki, a lab-wide task board, and a lab-wide project board.

* In the LAByrinth Wiki on Notion you'll need to: 1) gain access to Box, 2) gain access to Miro, 3) gain access to our gCal with meeting times, etc.  

* Read this Lab Book!

* Go to the LAByrinth [Website](https://labyrinth.garden) and start reading the backlog of [articles](https://labyrinth.garden/research/) + listening to our [podcast series](https://labyrinth.garden/podcast/) (spotify [here](https://open.spotify.com/show/4QW3ZgP3RddumZdPRLJZzw))

* Make sure you've completed the relevant [Citi Training](https://about.citiprogram.org/?_ga=2.215811861.302232273.1694824859-363715810.1694824858). For most LAByrinth members this is "Group 1: Human Subjects Research" but if you have questions [email](toubian@ucla.edu) Sophia. 

* Understand lab expectations—manage your own time, solve problems to the best of your ability, use the entire lab as a resource.

* Start a schedule of tasks—what are you going to work on, when? Work with your project group to delegate. Ask Sophia to help you with this (if you need help).

* Lastly, we order food to some of our All-Hands lab meetings and want everyone to enjoy what we get! Please send Sophia an [email](toubian@ucla.edu) if you have any dietary restrictions (or preferences) and we will do our absolute best to accommodate! There will always be vegetarian options present, but let us know if you are vegan, gluten-free, lactose intolerant, or just really don't like bell peppers. Also always feel free to bring your own food to meetings if you prefer to do so. 

#### A Note on Discord

We use discord for all intra-lab communication. That being said, it can be a fun place! We highly encourage the sharing of relevant media and love to see all of LAByrinth enjoying each other's projects. 

### Exiting the Lab

* Communal round robin during a meeting: what we valued about your work with us.
* Make sure you've returned all borrowed equipment (recorders, etc.)
* Exit interview.

Exit interview:
1. How was your overall experience working in the lab?
2. How did your fellow lab members make you feel / how did you feel in the lab environment (approachable? Comfortable to talk to to? Easy to work with?...)
3. What is the most valuable thing you learned? What else did you learn?
4. How do you think your work/experience in the lab could have been different?
5. What stood in the way of you getting your work done (if anything)? 
6. What would you like to learn that you didn’t get to?
7. Would you like to come back to work in the lab? If so, what would you choose to work on?
8. Is there anything else about your experiences that you would like to share?

## Project Management Protocol

The lab uses Notion to keep track of us as a whole. 

### Wiki

The LAByrinth Wiki on Notion serves as our home page and collection of resources. Here you will find links to the website, gCal, Box, Miro, etc. There is also a link to this Manual. 

### Projects

The Projects page is set up such that the whole lab knows what's being worked on. Inputs are sorted by status, and then by group and have room for notes internally. This space is for planning out and completing long(ish)-term, broader parts of the 3 main projects. 

### Tasks

The Tasks page serves as a masterlist of all the detailed tasks that need to be carried out under all the broader projects within groups. Each tasks needs a (somewhat strong) deadline and a person assigned to it. Tasks are each group's responsibility to come up with, log, and complete - they are not assigned by Chris or Sophia. 

### Licensing

When we want to encourage the free and fair sharing of our work without cost, we use a [Creative Commons Share-Alike license ](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0/).  

When we publish, we prefer open access journals, small scholar-run journals and journals that are not extractive of university labor, where possible.  Sadly, this is not always possible.

For the podcast series, we publish the podcast to listen to freely but not to copy and redistribute.  Our aim is not to make money on what we do, but to simply make it widely available, as permanently as possible.

### Research on Humans and Animals

We study animals, but not directly (yet).  For the time being none of our projects involve direct interaction with animals, only humans who know something about humans.  Participant-based fieldwork with such people may require training in animal care and ethical research, always ask. 

### Ethics of Care: Humans and their Data

As a lab that does a lot of ethnographic research, we work with other humans frequently. As such, we have adopted an ethics of care that prioritizes the communities and individuals that we work with. All our work with humans falls under the UCLA IRB when necessary, and all applicable lab members are required to have the relevant [Citi Training](https://about.citiprogram.org/?_ga=2.215811861.302232273.1694824859-363715810.1694824858). 

The current IRB for the Labyrinth Project is IRB#17-000297  

Consult with Chris if you need consent forms, sample questions, etc. for an interview.  Please do not conduct interviews unless you have had both CITI and Labyrinth training and instruction on doing it well. 

Most of the data that we publish about humans (in any medium) is either made pseudo-anonymous or completely anonymous, any decision not to do so should be made by the subject and approved by Chris in alignment with IRB guidelines.
